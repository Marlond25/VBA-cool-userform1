# VBA-cool-userform1
I created a simple series of 3 userforms to register some information into an Excel spreadsheet.

I even made an "interface" in the spreadsheet ;)

It is worth sharing because it was my first completed functional project that involved some code and I really enjoyed it. I didn't know a lot of build-in functions from VBA so i had to make my own.

Some of the code is in "Spanish". further in time I would realized that I could've just write everything in english :P

Go to the code to see... The code :)
